This map-app lets a user explore through a map and drop markers for different places they have been. They can add entries with photos and a description. The user can keep track of different adventures and memories through the years by adding an entry. The user navigates by "grabbing" the screen and zooms by double clicking/ using the zoom buttons in the top left corner. An entry is added by a clicking on the location where the memory happened and filling out the form. The location data (Lat/Long, town, state, country) are added automatically once clicked.

This application was built with a React frontend, featuring React Mapbox for the map functionality and uses the Geonames API to request geographic data for each potential entry. The requests for entries are made to the Node Js backend, which stores data in MongoDB.
